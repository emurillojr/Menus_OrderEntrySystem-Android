# Menus_OrderEntrySystem-Android
Menu using Order Entry System Lab3.2 <br>
Take Order Entry System Lab 1 and add several menu functions to it <br>
They are: <br>
• New – this will be done with an icon. When selected, the screen will be set back to its default value <br>
• Double Order – this will double the number of chocolate bars currently displayed <br>
• New – same as the first menu option but this one will be text only <br>
(note - set it to have the same icon as the first New option) <br>
You will not need to code this menu option to do anything <br>
• Get First Order – this option will set the screen to load up the first order that has been saved <br>
Note, do not hardcode values for setting the chocolate bar  <br>
Programmatically determine what the value is and set it ( do not use loop) <br>
Hint: look at the adapter’s getPosition method <br>
